# Machine Learning Based Prediction For Hierarchical Disease Classification
Using ML to predict diseases from symptoms, with the hierarchy of diseases.
The described project follows a methodology that involves dataset selection, data preprocessing, and the application of relevant classifiers and predictors to obtain the desired output. The dataset used for training was obtained from Kaggle and contained binary values with symptoms as columns and diseases as rows. Irrelevant rows and columns were removed. The pre-processing stage involved searching for disease hierarchies on the Disease Ontology website and manually identifying the hierarchy of diseases in the test dataset. A hierarchy was created at two levels, with three classes at level one (immunological, degenerate, and genetic) and further subclassifications at level two. For efficiency, a new dataset was created for each subclassification. To avoid information loss, 17 classifiers were used at different levels to traverse the hierarchy to predict the target disease. Predictors were used at nodes to predict the disease and its hierarchy. The last column of the dataset was in string format, and a label encoder was used to convert categorical values into numerical values.
